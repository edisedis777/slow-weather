**Slow Weather** is an interactive web application that visualizes weather data as a dynamic landscape. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches real-time weather information from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and transforms it into a scenic display featuring a terrain shaped by hourly temperatures, a swaying leaf indicating wind speed, and atmospheric effects like rain, snow, and clouds.

### üéâ Demo:
Try it Live: [Here](https://edisedis777.github.io/slow-weather/)


### ‚òÅÔ∏è Features
- **Dynamic Terrain**: The landscape‚Äôs height varies with hourly temperature data over a 24-hour period.
- **Weather Effects**: 
  - Raindrops or snowflakes fall based on precipitation levels and temperature (rain if > 0¬∞C, snow if < 0¬∞C).
  - Clouds drift across the sky proportional to cloud cover.
  - Day/night sky transitions.
- **Time Axis**: Integrated at the terrain‚Äôs base, showing 6-hour intervals (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, 24:00).
- **Temperature Toggle**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit with a button anchored to the terrain.
- **Responsive Design**: Rounded corners and a clean layout adapt to various screen sizes.

### üíΩ Installation:
**Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone
   cd weather-landscape
### Open the Project:
No dependencies required! Simply open index.html in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Alternatively, serve it locally using a tool like Live Server in VS Code:
bash
npx live-server

### ‚å®Ô∏è Usage
Enter a City:
Type a city name (e.g., "London", "New York") into the input field and press Enter or click "Show Weather".

### üó∫Ô∏è Explore the Landscape:
Observe the terrain shaping based on the city‚Äôs hourly temperature forecast.
Watch the leaf sway with wind speed, and note precipitation effects (rain/snow).
Toggle between ¬∞C and ¬∞F using the button at the terrain‚Äôs base.

### ü¶ú Interact:
The sun/moon adjusts with day/night status, and clouds reflect current cloud cover.
The time axis aligns with the terrain‚Äôs 24-hour temperature profile.
Zen mode for a distraction-free experience.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Data Source: Uses Open-Meteo‚Äôs free weather API for current and hourly forecast data **(no API key required).**

Tech Stack:
#### HTML: Structure for the landscape and UI elements.
#### CSS: Styling with animations (swaying leaf, drifting clouds, falling precipitation).
#### JavaScript: Fetches weather data, updates the SVG terrain, and manages dynamic effects.

### ü•° Key Components:
SVG terrain with integrated time axis.
Temperature-driven precipitation and color changes.
